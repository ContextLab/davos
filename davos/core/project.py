"""
"Project" system for isolating smuggled dependencies.

This module implements davos's "Project" scheme for isolating packages
smuggled in a davos-enhanced notebook from the main Python environment,
as well as from those smuggled in other davos-enhanced notebooks.
Functionally, a davos project is similar to Python virtual environment,
with a few main differences:
    - davos projects do not need to be set up, activated, or deactivated
      manually; they are automatically created and used when
      davos-enhanced notebooks are run.
    - davos projects *extend*, rather than replace, the main Python
      environment; they contain only the dependencies of davos-enhanced
      notebooks that are not already satisfied by the packages available
      in those notebooks' "normal" Python environments.
    - davos projects do not contain their own Python or pip executables;
      packages are installed into them using the pip executable from the
      Python environment used to run the notebook kernel.
All davos projects are stored in `davos.DAVOS_PROJECT_DIR`
(`~/.davos/projects/`). By default, each davos-enhanced notebook will
create and use a notebook-specific project named for the path to the
notebook file. Any packages (or specific package versions) smuggled in
that notebook that are not already available in the main Python
environment will be installed into and loaded from the project's
isolated package directory (along with any dependencies of those
packages not already available in the main environment). This way, davos
automatically ensures all smuggled packages and specific package
versions are available at runtime without altering the main Python
environment.

davos projects can also be shared by multiple notebooks. The project
used by the current notebook can be accessed and set via the
`davos.project` (or `davos.config.project`) attribute. When accessed,
the value of `davos.project` will always be a
`davos.core.project.ConcreteProject` instance, but the attribute can
also be assigned either a `str` or `pathlib.Path`, which will be
converted to a `ConcreteProject` internally on assignment. The same
project can be used by multiple notebooks simply by setting
`davos.project` to the same value at the top of each one. While
notebook-specific projects are typically (and by default) named for the
notebook's path, notebook-agnostic projects can be given arbitrary names
(that are not file paths), e.g., `davos.project = "my-project"`.

        Delete the project and all installed packages.

        currently in use (i.e., is the Project assigned to

        Rename the project to `new_name`.

        Change the name of the project to `new_name` and rename its

        Python object is then "reloaded" so these updates are reflected
        in its attribute values, and potentially its type as well.

        Renaming a project has two main use cases:
            1. Editing the name of a non-notebook-specific project
               (i.e., a project with a notebook-agnostic name like
               "stats101-notebooks"), if desired.
            2. Re-linking a notebook-specific project with its
               associated notebook after that notebook has been
               moved or renamed.
        Notebook-specific projects (which davos-enhanced notebooks use
        by default) are named for the path to the notebook whose
        smuggled packages they contain. If that notebook is moved or
        renamed, its associated project will become an `AbstractProject`
        because the path it's associated with (i.e., named for) no
        longer exists. And running the moved/renamed notebook would
        create a new project and reinstall all packages, because there
        would be no project associated with its new path. Instead, the
        existing project can continue to be used by renaming it to match
        the notebook's new path. The project's name, package directory,
        and Python object will be updated to reflect the notebook's
        `new_name`, including converting its type from an
        `AbstractProject` to a `ConcreteProject`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        new_name : str or pathlib.Path
            The new name for the project. This name must not already be

def cleanup_project_dir_atexit(dirpath):

    Remove project directory on interpreter termination, if empty.

    Each Project instance eagerly creates its `.project_dir` on
    instantiation so it's available for use, then if it isn't used,
    removes it in its finalizer method (`Project.__del__`) to avoid
    cluttering up the user's `DAVOS_PROJECT_DIR` with empty directories.
    However, IPython stores its own internal references to objects in
    the user namespace and releases them after the kernel shuts down and
    this module is unloaded, so Projects that exist at interpreter
    shutdown can't be cleaned up. IPython also stores references to any
    objects that appear in cell outputs via its output caching system
    (https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html#output-caching-system)
    so any Project whose repr is displayed in the notebook also won't
    have its reference count drop to zero before shutdown.

    As a backup, each Project instance registers a call to this function
    with `atexit.register()`, so any empty project dirs that still exist
    at shutdown will be caught and removed. This function is defined
    outside the Project class so the atexit registry doesn't store a
    reference to the instance unnecessarily for the whole session.

        If `True` (default: `False`), don't prompt for confirmation

    Notes
    -----
    1. By default, user confirmation (y/n input) is required before
       deleting each project, but this can be bypassed by passing
       `yes=True`. Note that if davos's non-interactive mode is enabled
       (i.e., `davos.noninteractive` has been set to `True`), `yes=True`
       *must* be explicitly passed to prune projects. This serves as a
       safeguard against unintentionally deleting projects, since
       non-interactive mode disables all user input and confirmation.
    2. The function will also remove any project directories (other than
       the currently active project's) that contain no installed
       packages. However, this is done silently since the intended
       behavior is for empty projects to be removed automatically when
