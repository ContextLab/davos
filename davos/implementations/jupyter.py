def auto_restart_rerun(pkgs):
    """
    Jupyter-specific implementation of `auto_restart_rerun`.

    Automatically restarts the notebook kernel and reruns all cells
    above, *including the current cell*. Called when one or more
    smuggled `pkgs` that were previously imported cannot be reloaded by
    the current interpreter, and `davos.config.auto_rerun` is set to
    `True`. Displays a message in the cell output area with the
    package(s) that required the kernel restart, calls
    `JS_FUNCTIONS.jupyter.restartRunCellsAbove`, and then blocks until
    the kernel is restarted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkgs : list of str
        Packages that could not be reloaded without restarting the
        kernel.

    See Also
    --------
    JS_FUNCTIONS.jupyter.restartRunCellsAbove :
        JavaScript function that restarts kernel and reruns cells above

    Notes
    -----
    1. The message displayed before restarting the kernel can be
       silenced by setting `davos.config.suppress_stdout` to `True`.
    2. After calling `JS_FUNCTIONS.jupyter.restartRunCellsAbove`, this
       function sleeps until the kernel restarts to prevent any further
       code in the current cell or other queued cells from executing.
       Restarting the kernel is often not instantaneous; there's
       generally a 1-2s delay while the kernel sends & receives various
       shutdown messages, but it can take significantly longer on a slow
       machine, with older Python/Jupyter/ipykernel versions, if a large
       amount of data was loaded into memory, if multiple notebook
       kernels are running at once, etc. If this function returned
       immediately, it's likely subsequent lines of code would be run
       before the kernel disconnected. This can cause problems if those
       lines of code use the package(s) that prompted the restart, or
       have effects that persist across kernel sessions.

def prompt_restart_rerun_buttons(pkgs):
    """
    Jupyter-specific implementation of `prompt_restart_rerun_buttons`.

    Displays a warning that the notebook kernel must be restarted in
    order to use the just-smuggled version of one or more previously
    imported `pkgs`, and displays a pair of buttons (via
    `JS_FUNCTIONS.jupyter.displayButtonPrompt`) that prompt the user to
    either (a) restart the kernel and rerun all cells up to the current
    point, or (b) ignore the warning and continue running. Then, polls
    the kernel's stdin socket until it receives a reply from the
    notebook frontend, or the kernel is restarted.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pkgs : list of str
        Packages that could not be reloaded without restarting the
        kernel.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        If the user clicks the "Continue Running" button, returns
        `None`. Otherwise, restarts the kernel and therefore never
        returns.

    See Also
    --------
    JS_FUNCTIONS.jupyter.displayButtonPrompt :
        JavaScript function for prompting user input with buttons.
    ipykernel.kernelbase.Kernel._input_request :
        Kernel method that replaces the built-in `input` in notebooks.

    Notes
    -----
    1. This method of blocking and waiting for user input is based on
       `ipykernel`'s replacement for the built-in `input` function used
       in notebook environments.
